   abstract = {The aim of this study was to semi-automate process analytics for the quantification of common impurities in downstream processing such as host cell DNA, host cell proteins and endotoxins using a commercial liquid handling station. By semi-automation, the work load to fully analyze the elution peak of a purification run was reduced by at least 2.41 h. The relative standard deviation of results among different operators over a time span of up to 6 months was at the best reduced by half, e.g. from 13.7 to 7.1% in dsDNA analysis. Automation did not improve the reproducibility of results produced by one operator but released time for data evaluation and interpretation or planning of experiments. Overall, semi-automation of process analytics reduced operator-specific influence on test results. Such robust and reproducible analytics is fundamental to establish process analytical technology and get downstream processing ready for Quality by Design approaches.},

   abstract = {Air-displacement pipettes are easy-to-use instruments for small-volume liquid transfer, but they are prone to volume errors resulting from handling, ambient conditions and liquid properties. Analytical thermodynamic approaches were used to describe and quantify influencing factors affecting volume. Results were compared with measurements. Effects related to temperature difference between liquid and instrument by far prevail over the dependence on common temperature level of liquid, instrument and environment. An equation based on Fick’s laws was developed to calculate volatilization effects in the captive air volume explaining the dependence on ambient moisture, pipetting pace, waiting period and unconditioned starting. Furthermore, dependence on barometric pressure, angle of inclination, liquid density, immersion depth and surface energy in tips was calculated and/or measured. The review allows a comprehensive insight into the size of volume errors in calibration and use. These effects are typically much higher than those resulting from gravimetric measurement.},

   abstract = {Pipettes are essential tools for biomedical and analytical laboratories, analogous to workstations for computer scientists. Variation in pipetting is a known unknown, as it is generally accepted that variations exist, but thus far, there have been limited studies on the extent of these variations in practice. In this mini-review, we highlight how manual pipetting is a key technique in the laboratory, and, although simple, inaccuracy and imprecision exist. If variations are not adequately addressed, errors can be compounded and consequently compromise data quality. Determination of the accuracy and precision of manual pipetting is straightforward, and here we review two common approaches that use gravimetry and spectrophotometry as readouts. We also provide detailed protocols for determination of accuracy and precision using manual single and multi-channel pipettes. These simple-to-use methods can be used by any laboratory for competency training and regular checks. Having a common protocol for evaluation of variation will also enable cross-laboratory comparison and potentially facilitate establishment of a reference value of acceptable ranges for operator error. Such a value could be of relevance to the scientific community for benchmarking and assuring good laboratory practice.},

   abstract = {Self-driving laboratories are being investigated as a potential means to accelerate the material discovery process. Accurate liquid handling is an essential operation in the context of chemical laboratories, and consequently a self-driving laboratory will require robotic liquid handling and transfer. Although many pipettes are available for human scientists, robots cannot manipulate these pipettes due to the limitations of current robot gripper morphology. We propose an intuitive yet elegant design for a 3D-printed digital pipette designed for robots to carry out chemical experiments. It costs less than 200 USD, and the simple design with three parts enables a new user to assemble one in 10 minutes. We conducted a performance evaluation that closely followed ISO 8655-6. Our results show that robots with the digital pipette could conduct accurate liquid delivery with 0.2% random error for the nominal volume (10 mL). This performance is comparable to commercially available liquid handling devices, whose typical random errors are 0.3%.},
